# BURN THE CONTRIBUTOR COVENANT WITH FIRE!

## This is not an incitement to violence and\/or property damage
This should go without saying, but we live in unhinged and delusional times\. \"Burn the Contributor Covenant with Fire\" is not in any way an incitement toward violence or property damage\. The item in question is digital\. It is merely a metaphor expressing intense disapproval of the Contributor Covenant and unwillingness to use it on my own projects\.

## Introduction
The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is the most prevalent Code of Conduct on Github. It is the default Code of Conduct included in the generators for many open source frameworks. While to the casual reader, it may seem benign, the actual use of the Contributor Covenant by those who were instrumental in its creation and adoption has been to weaponize it and use it as a mechanism to silence those whose ideas do not conform to the radical political left, even to the point of getting project founders kicked off of their projects.

## Statement on Diversity and Inclusion
I'm all for actual diversity and actual inclusion\. The vast majority of those who are the most vocal about \"Diversity and Inclusion\" and get the HR enforcer jobs tend to be deeply offended by actual diversity or any inclusion of those with whom they might disagree\. If you replace \"Diversity and Inclusion\" with \"Conformity and Exclusion\" you'll get a pretty good idea of what the actual goals are\.

### People are Unique Individuals
People are unique individuals\. Each human being is truly unique in all of human history\. Each human being has a unique background, set of beliefs, and perspective on life\. These differences enrich us\.

### Reducing people to a set of classes and attributes is demeaning
As a method of enforcing conformity to political correctness, the Contributor Covenant is all about categorizing people according to \(but not limited to\) the classic government protected classes\. This collectivist mindset is used to pressure people to conform to the expectations that progressives have for that class\. \"You're not \[insert protected class here\] enough\" is used exclusively by the political left as a method of social manipulation to bully people into thinking and acting alike based on attributes they may possess\.

### Inclusion also means including people with whom you disagree
As somebody who holds minority views on a great many subjects, I could not function if I limited my interactions to only those who agreed with me\. There is not one human being alive that I cannot learn something from or teach something to\. If I were to write off people who disagree with me \(even on things that I care about most\) with the non-person dismissal labels that the progressives use to try to destroy people, it would impoverish me\.

### For all the talk of \"empathy\" the enforcers have little empathy for people who have trouble complying through no fault of their own
The enforcers love to jump on people for violations related to tone and wording\. This displays little empathy for contributors who are participating in a second \(or nth\) language\. Even among native speakers, much is lost in translation from speaking in person to audio to digital\. How inclusive are you truly being if everybody who is a non-native speaker or those who have disabilities or mental illnesses that make it difficult for them to comply with arbitrary and one\-sided enforcement of a code of conduct\? If you are a non-native speaker of a language, you had better learn some politically correct platitudes because you\'re going to need them lest you get devoured and kicked off the project by the champions of Diversity and Inclusion\.

## The Contributor Covenant was designed by Code of Conduct Trolls for Code of Conduct Trolls
As much as the original Contributor Covenant docs and [FAQ](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/faq/) claimed that they were not intending to ruin people\'s lives for conduct outside of their project, it quickly became clear that the primary creator of the CC is  [Code of Conduct Troll Prime](https://github.com/opal/opal/issues/941). You look to the conduct of the writers of a document to see how it is likely to be used and enforced\. The U.S. Constitution may have looked good to some on paper, but seeing how Alexander Hamilton used the document after he convinced people to adopt it, it's pretty clear that he intended it as a malicious Trojan Horse document\. In the same way, the Prime Mover of the CC was just itching to get people who have unapproved thoughts to adopt the Contributor Covenant in order to use it to remove them from their own projects\.

### The enforcement is intentionally asymmetrical
Like Orwell's Animal Farm, some protected attributes are more equal than others. If, for example, you actually believe the sacred text(s) of your ancient religion and they are not in line with 21st century political leftism, there is a **zero percent chance** that a progressive founder of a project will get kicked off of their project for offending a religious conservative\. If a religious conservative said something 10 years ago that is now deemed offensive, the Code of Conduct Trolls will be out for blood\.

### The Contributor Covenant is Calvinball
The Contributor Covenant proudly proclaims on its homepage that it is a \"living document\.\" Given the history of other \"living documents\" that means that whoever gets the enforcement power on a project has the ability to arbitrarily change the interpretation of the rules and take retroactive disciplinary action on anybody who at any time in the past had behavior that is now not in compliance with the living document\. At least if you play real [Calvinball](https://calvinandhobbes.fandom.com/wiki/Calvinball), you know in advance that the rules are subject to change on a whim and there isn't a Trojan Horse generator that turns every new game into Calvinball\.

## I'm not agreeing to set up an enforcement bureaucracy on my project
Part of adopting the Contributor Covenant is agreeing to set up an enforcement bureaucracy\. On small projects, committing to this level of overhead is impractical and unrealistic\. Most open source projects are small projects and having a default for your framework where you need an enforcement committee is overkill\. Even if there were not all of the other problems with the Contributor Covenant above, this should be enough to disqualify it as a default\.

### The project maintainer(s) reserve the right to moderate content but are under no obligation to do so
If you act like a jerk on the project, the maintainers reserve the right to moderate your content, but are under no obligation to do so and make no warranty express or implied that action will be taken\.

### If you enthusiastically embrace the Contributor Covenant, you are welcome to contribute
Contributing to this project doesn't mean that you endorse or agree to this document\. You can be all about the Contributor Covenant everywhere else, but _you have no power to enforce it here_\. You are free to criticize my lack of adoption and this document to your heart's content\.

## I will not reject or revert commits based on what somebody said outside of the code itself
This is a software project\. The purpose of it is to write working software\. If you are a jerk in the way that you bring an issue to our attention, we might moderate the issue, but we're not going to reject the idea or the pull request because it came from somebody who is not behaving properly\. Contributions to the project will be judged on the merit of those contributions themselves, not the virtue of the individual submitting them\.

## If you don't like it, you can fork it
This is an open source project\. If you don't like how the project maintainers run the show, you are free to fork it and have your own project\. There is nothing stopping you\.

## It\'s okay to disagree
In fact, it\'s encouraged. How boring life would be if we all thought alike\! I realize that publishing this document is going to make me some enemies, but somebody needs to stand up to the bullies who are actively working to exclude anybody with the slightest deviation from the ever\-moving target of politically correct speech.
